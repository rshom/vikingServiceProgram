# Service Team and Equipment

Viking is fully prepared for any job of any size. We have multiple **manufacturer trained technicians** with specializations in **lifts, compressors, lubrication/exhaust systems, and shop equipment**.  We have acquired our knowledge through experience and rarely encounter problems we haven't seen before. All technicians are Viking employed. **We don't subcontract any service**.

In addition to our team, we own the right equipment for every job. This includes a fleet of trucks, fork lifts, scissor lifts, heavy duty trailers, and every specialty tool required. We don't need to improvise solutions because we are already **prepared with the parts, equipment, and experience required for any job**.

# Parts Inventory

Viking maintains the **largest lift parts inventory in New England**. We get our **OEM parts** direct from manufacturer giving our customers the **best possible price**.

Because we keep such a large inventory, we can generally **solve service calls in one visit**. While our competitors show up first to diagnose and order parts, we show up with everything need to fix your lift in minimal time.

For the lifts below, we stock the listed **parts on the shelf** plus more. In addition to lifts, we stock **parts for compressors, lubrication and exhaust systems, tire changers, wheel balancers, and more**.
